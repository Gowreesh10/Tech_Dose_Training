Why we use 10^9 + 7 as mod?
---------------------------

    =>It should just be large enough to fit in the largest integer data type i.e it makes sure that there is no overflow in the result.
    =>It should be a prime number because if we take mod of a number by Prime the result is generally spaced i.e. the results are very different results in comparison to mod the number by non-prime, that is why primes are generally used for mod.

10^9+7 fulfills both the criteria. It is the first 10-digit prime number and fits in int data type as well. In fact, any prime number less than 2^30 will be fine in order to prevent possible overflows.

How modulo is used:
-------------------


A few distributive properties of modulo are as follows:


    =>( a + b) % c = ( ( a % c ) + ( b % c ) ) % c
    =>( a * b) % c = ( ( a % c ) * ( b % c ) ) % c
    =>( a – b) % c = ( ( a % c ) – ( b % c ) ) % c

    (a % m + m) % m == > if negative result

    =>( a / b ) % c = ( ( a % c ) / ( b % c ) ) % c --- > Not Applicable


Catalan Numbers:
-----------------

1) The number of valid parenthesis expressions that consist of N right parenthesis and N left parethesis
2) No of different ways (N+1) factors can be completely parenthesised.
3) A rooted binary tree with one root node, where each npde has either 0 or 2 branches descending from it.How many rooted binary trees are there with N internal nodes.
4) Count of structurally unique BSTs with K-keys is Cn.
5) Count no of ways to divide a circle using N non-intersecting chords
6) No. of ways to reach from bottom left to top right without crossing the main diagonal and always pointing to right or top.
7) All possible binary trees with given inorder treversal
